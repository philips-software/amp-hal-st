**Description**: amp-hal-st is a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) implementation for a range of [ST](https://st.com) ARM Cortex-based micro-controllers. amp-hal-st implements the interfaces defined as part of [EmbeddedInfraLib].

## Dependencies

amp-hal-st requires:
- [EmbeddedInfraLib].

## How to build the software

amp-hal-st cannot be built by-itself, it must be built as part of a larger project. This paragraph describes how to add amp-hal-st to a CMake build-system, using [EmbeddedInfraLib].

> CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21)

    hal_st.stm32fxxx
)

```

## How to test the software

Due to the nature of amp-hal-st: a HAL implementation, there are no included automated tests. Testing should be done in-context on the target hardware.
