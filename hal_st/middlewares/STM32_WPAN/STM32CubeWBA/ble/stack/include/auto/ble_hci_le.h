 * The Set Controller To Host Flow Control Command is used to turn flow control
 * on or off.
 * The Host_ACL_Data_Packet_Length command parameter will be used to determine
 * the size of the L2CAP segments contained in ACL Data Packets, which are
 * transferred from the Controller to the Host.
 * The Host_Synchronous_Data_Packet_Length command parameter is used to
 * determine the maximum size of HCI synchronous Data Packets. Both the Host
 * and the Controller shall support command and event packets, where the data
 * portion (excluding header) contained in the packets is 255 octets in size.
 * The Host_Total_Num_ACL_Data_Packets command parameter contains the total
 * number of HCI ACL Data Packets that can be stored in the data buffers of the
 * Host. The Controller will determine how the buffers are to be divided
 * between different Connection_Handles.
 * The Host_Total_Num_Synchronous_Data_Packets command parameter gives the same
 * information for HCI synchronous Data Packets.
 * Note: The Host_ACL_Data_Packet_Length and

 * completed. The command may be sent at any time by the Host when there is at

 * The Own_Address_Type parameter determines the address used (Public or Random
 * Device Address) when performing active scan.
 * The Host shall not issue this command when scanning is enabled in the
 * Controller; if it is the Command Disallowed error code shall be used.
 * See Bluetooth spec. v.5.4 [Vol 4, Part E, 7.8.10].
